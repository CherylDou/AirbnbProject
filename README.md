# Seattle and Boston Airbnb Comparison
In this project, Seattle and Boston Airbnb data is used to understand how much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas.
I will compare data between two cities, and try to understand if there is anything about the properties that helps me predict price.
Three questions are answered:
How many valid records to predict Boston / Seattle Airbnb price;
Price distribution comparison;
Build a Multi Linear Regression model to predict price

# Project Motivation
I am learning Data Science with Udacity. It's a great project to apply what I've learned.
